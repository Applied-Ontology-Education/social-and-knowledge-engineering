## Repository Content
This repository contains the following directories: 

* **lectures** - Slides for lectures given by the instructor of the course.
* **presentations** - Slides for presentations given by participants in the course. 
* **readings** - Required readings for the course.

The goal of this course is train presentation and preparation skills as applied to the domain of knowledge engineering. This includes factors which affect social influence, the underlying mechanisms for them, how they are applied in real world situations. To this end, the course will provide evidence-based drills to practice leveraging body language, metaphor, rhyming, tone, and ideological convictions to persuade small and large audiences. The aim of this course is for you to leave a more competent, confident, and polished presenter, as well as an informed critic of those charmers in the world attempting to persuade you.
